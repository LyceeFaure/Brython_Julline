t1 = "Undertale is a role-playing game (RPG)  that came out for the first time on pc in 2015 after it was cross-platformed on playstation, switch and xbox. The creator of this masterpiece is Toby fox; and the fun fact with him is that at the beginning, he was a beginner in video game development when he made this game. He was actually a composer. So this is why undertale is popular for the soundtrack ! Toby imagines a universe with a thematic he wants to illustrate and create. With the demos he publishes, a lot of people encourage the developer to continu, to see this game see the light."

t2="At the beginning of the game, we have an intro that explains the context. A long time ago, humans and monsters lived together, but one day, a war broke out and the monsters lost against the humans. Monsters have been locked up in the underground. In the game, we play a character named Frisk, a young child who falls into the underground where monsters live. Here our adventure begins ! The gameplay is really special because you, the player, have choices to make, like kill or not kill monsters, and it will really change the world around our hero, and mentally us actually ! Why ? because there's your timeline. And you have the choice of making the run pacifique where nobody is dead and you choose to spare everyone; The neutral run where some monsters are dead but not all of them, or the more affected one, the run Genocide were nobody makes it. Before we talk about the tactical of fight, let's see how it look !"

t3 = "So here its how the game look, Toby fox with his inspiration, made this game with the design of with pixel art in 2d and good decorations for each place in the game. He make this choice because, remember he wasn't strong for a developer of video game."

t4 = " All begin with a question, “ Why are we killing monsters in our favorite game ?” Because  we are rewarded with experience, trophies, equipment; it pushes us to continue. That frustrates Toby Fox who would want an rpg where nobody should be injured, where we encourage dialogue, negotiation rather than murder. It will therefore be based on its vision of things to make it the heart of its history. Deciding whether to spare or fight the monsters has real consequences on our relationships with the characters and the world around us. 'I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO MAKE EACH MONSTER FEEL LIKE A FULL-FLEDGED INDIVIDUAL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, ALL MONSTERS IN RPG ARE THE SAME THEY ATTACK YOU, YOU HEAL YOURSELF, YOU ATTACK THEM, THEY DIE'. It doesn’t make sense. Therefore, Undertale will push the idea by making empathy and understanding the heart of his gameplay.By the desire to have fun, the player wants to kill everybody; toby fox knows it so it for this reason those characters are so endearing. When you want to kill a monster, you alway hesitate before the act, not because they are difficult to fight but because we love them, we have learned to know them and they are not just monsters but  also people with their dear, their anxiety and their dream; we are endearing."
